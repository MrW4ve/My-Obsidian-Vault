# Workflow
We want to minimize the time spent organizing and changing systems. Conversely want to easily index our notes and navigate them in a way that allows us to see our chains-of-thought. We also want to have consistency, so we need to define standard workflows to use. 

### Meat of the Workflow - Notes!
#### Fleeting Notes - the Starter Pokemon.
Got a distracting idea keeping you from focusing? A train of thought you canâ€™t lose? A sudden impulse that you need to find if your current workflow is truly the best one? 
Great, Type it up!
Its now a **fleeting idea**, bookmarked for your brain later.

Now the fleeting note can be reviewed and refined later until it evolves into a new form - like a Pokemon!

#### Dealing with Fleeting Notes.
Fleeting notes should be reviewed daily. They can be expanded on as much or little as you want. 

If its a resource you found and are saving for later tag it with `#resource` and add `topic : [[topic-link]]` 

If its a call for action you want to take on, put it in your daily Scheduled Tasks, with a priority and date/time.

If it has >2 placeholders of calls to action (like `[[Make a demo]]`) tag it with `#project` add `topic : [[topic-link]]`. 

If its a note you want to reference to later tag it with `#topic` and add `topic : [[topic-link]]`. 

### Types of Notes

#### Fleeting
Fleeting notes are incomplete notes, thoughts, ideas etc. Every new idea and note, is a fleeting note.

#### Topics
Tag with topic tag. Used by other notes for managing category's of topics by linking to the topic note, also is a breadcrumb.

#### Resources
Tag with resources or video tag, link to topic. Used for saving resources for later, along with direct notes on it.

#### Projects
Tag with project tag, link with topic. If a note/fleeting note has >2 placeholders of calls to action (like `[[Make a demo]]`), than it becomes a project.

#### Notes
Tag with notes, link with topic. Used for finished notes that don't fall under resources or projects.
