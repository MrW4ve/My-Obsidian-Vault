# Big Bang
#### The Commitment
My note taking database starts here. Use it.

Don't over complicate it, just use it and let it evolve. Don't restart and delete it from this point on, just change how you use it. Take notes about topics your learning, write down daily plans, work efficiently with this evolving system. If you get frustrated, adapt it to your needs. Nothing is perfect.

#### WORKING ON THIS ECOSYSTEM IS NOT CONSIDERED WORK.
**This is a productivity tool, not a procrastination simulator.** 
If you allow this, it will consume all of your time. Its a hobby space at best. It feels productive and smart - but its a trap. This applies to all anything around building your productivity spaces. Its entertainment - and lost time. [This video makes good points around this. (Yes, this is hypocrisy)](https://youtu.be/DRBXGOr6faU?si=vVaU9Zw6MEwjtbT9)

Start as simple and barebones as possible, don't spend your time building bloatware. Than only increase complexity once your life proves that you need it.
