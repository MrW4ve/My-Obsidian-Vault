He states that you should declare bankruptcy on your memory. We are bad at remembering all the things we think of and learn. Your brain is for having ideas, not storing them.

Carry a notebook or have a trusted system for writing things down. If something comes to mind or someone tells you something important.

A lot of the memory techniques discussed are around the changing the understanding that your mind is exclusively inside of your head to something that can be augmented by paper, pencil, and digital methods. This theory is called active externalism.

Put events on digital calendars. Events are things you will miss by distractions. 

[02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=140&v=XUZ9VATeF_4)
Events are not tasks that have a due date. Tasks should go to a separate task management system. If it can be done before the due date its a task, not a event.

There are a lot of task management systems, but the video focuses on highlighting David Alen’s Getting Things Done (GTD) which worked best for him.

GTD has tasks split into projects like many systems, but GTD has context tab (like laptop, home, work etc.) This can work by when you are in a specific context, you can filter out everything else that by definition you cant do at the moment. Task systems that don’t have a form of filtering can create more distractions.

Earplugs can help with sensory overload, and should be used when needed.

With autism it can be hard to read and interpret information when talking with people. Neural typical people have a lot of bandwidth for this information like tone, body language, vocal hesitations and extrapolate all this information into common understandings.

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess. If you can’t keep up with the same level of understanding, at the first hint of confusion or misunderstanding, communicate it. Say “I’m sorry, I don't understand” and let them try again. If they are still unclear say it again. If it happens a third time, they are not clearly communicating and you can say “I'm sorry, I don't think you understand”. Half the time they don’t and its not your responsibility to teach others how to communicate.

You need context in communication, ask for all relevant information needed.

Use a note-taking system that has hyperlinks like obsidian

Plain text lasts forever, don't lose your notes to services disappearing

You have ADHD. Don’t open your browser. Build a framework for getting stuff done. 

[07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=429&v=XUZ9VATeF_4)
A effective mechanism is called eat at the frog. Do the hardest, (most unpleasant task you don’t want to work on) first on your task list before you move on to the easy tasks. Not only does this help with your efficacy with limiting procrastiworking, but it also stops that looming feeling of having that task you know your putting off from dragging you down.

[07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=439&v=XUZ9VATeF_4)
Build habits. Triggers is a good but boring book on habits. When you do a task that you struggle with, pay attention to what is making you do it - the triggering behavior (like a location, thought, song etc.) than build a feedback loop for improving and chaining these those habits together

Tiny daily change adds up over time. The results might not be immediately available which may be discouraging, but if you for example wrote 400 words a day, in a year you could have 4 seasons of a podcast or video scripts. If you spend your time bouncing between 3 apps, you will end the year with nothing.

Public speaking is important. Its important and mandatory in the real world. Pay attention to who seems to know what they are taking about and what makes them good at explaining there thoughts to you. Talk with people clearly, precisely and with confidence.

[08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=506&v=XUZ9VATeF_4)
Imitate others. Pay attention to how people act and do what they do, it works in many contexts and is a form of learning.

Negative emotions are not very useful, save your energy and focus on the positives. Negative emotions can be useful in some cases and can indicate needs for change. Through practice you can influence what you feel and notice. Notice the negatives, but feel the positives.

[09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=554&v=XUZ9VATeF_4)
To feel the positives, you have to focus. There will be many choices in your everyday life, just pick one and focus. There’s dozens of new programing languages per year, just pick one and try it. There’s lots of games in your steam library, don’t waste time scrolling and staring at it, just choose one and play it. There is hundreds of sources of news, use RSS filters and filters not firehouse scrolling and read important things deeply.

[09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=574&v=XUZ9VATeF_4)
Just do it. The plural of word is sentence, the pleural of sentence is paragraph, and the plural of paragraph means you are done and can go back to playing video games. `“You put one word after another until its done. Its that easy, and that hard.” -Neil Galman`.

Timers are great. They can break up work and breaks into efficient patterns. The Pomodoro Technique is a lightweight system for managing your timers. The default recommendation is to set a 20 minute timer, work as fast as you can nonstop, than have a 5 minute timed break. This can trick you into hours of high-focused work and can be combined with focusing on specific contexts and chunks of work for time management and avoiding distractions.

Humanize, organize, and mechanize. His method of building systems in life and professionally. Humanize: do everything manfully on paper if needed for many iterations if needed. Organize: Notice the patterns that are creeping into your methods. Mechanize: Automate those patterns in a system, through checklists, flowcharts, or software. 

[10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=658&v=XUZ9VATeF_4)
One thing at a time. Most important thing first. Start now. Choose what you want to do and do it, and than keep it up.
